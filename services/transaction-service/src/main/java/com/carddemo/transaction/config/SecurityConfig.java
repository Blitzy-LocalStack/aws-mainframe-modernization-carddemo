/**
 * Configures who may reach this context's endpoints, and which tokens are accepted at all.
 *
 * <p>This is the migrated form of the authorization check the baseline performs by reading the user type
 * out of the session structure it echoes between screen turns, declared at
 * {@code app/cpy/COCOM01Y.cpy} lines 19 to 44 with its two condition names for the administrator and
 * the ordinary user. That structure is storage the CLIENT hands back, so a client could in principle
 * assert its own user type; here the equivalent claim is signed by the identity provider and validated
 * on every request, so it cannot be asserted by the caller at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>Assumptions: this class has the same three responsibilities in every context of this repository --
 * a filter chain, the group-to-authority conversion, and the decoder that installs the token checks the
 * issuer alone does not make. It reads the same five property keys in every context, so the eight chains
 * cannot diverge in what they accept, and the shared classes it composes live in {@code common-lib}
 * rather than being restated per service. Only the route table below is specific to this context.</p>
 *
 * <p>Refactoring Rationale: an earlier revision of this repository declared those five keys in each
 * service's configuration and read none of them. The values were therefore documentation of an intent
 * rather than a control: a resource server configured with an issuer location alone validates the
 * signature, the issuer and the time window, and the identity token this provider mints from the same
 * signing key satisfies all three. This class is where the declared keys became effective.</p>
 *
 * <p>Assumptions: no BUSINESS route here is administrator-only, and that is a preserved property rather
 * than an oversight -- the management namespace at {@link #MANAGEMENT_PATH} is administrator-only, and it
 * answers no business question. The baseline reaches transaction list, view, add and bill payment from
 * the MAIN menu,
 * {@code app/cbl/COMEN01C.cbl}, so all four are ordinary-user capabilities today. What this context
 * does tighten is the TOKEN it accepts, and it tightens it for a specific reason: these are the
 * operations whose misuse moves money, so a request admitted on an identity token would post against a
 * real account.</p>

     * that a browser does not attach automatically, so the confused-deputy condition the protection
     * defends against cannot arise. Leaving it enabled would reject every non-browser client --
     * including the load balancer -- for no gain.</p>
     *
     * <p>Assumptions: the catch-all requires one of the two GROUP authorities rather than merely
     * requiring authentication. Those are not the same condition. {@link JwtRoleConverter} grants an
     * EMPTY authority set for a token whose {@code cognito:groups} claim is absent, is not a collection,
     * holds a non-textual entry, or names only groups this application does not recognise -- and every
     * one of those tokens is still fully authenticated, because it carries a valid signature from the
     * configured pool. A rule of {@code authenticated()} therefore admitted a principal that had been
     * granted nothing, which is the missing-authorization defect the baseline does not have: the session
     * structure at {@code app/cpy/COCOM01Y.cpy} lines 19 to 44 always carries one of exactly two user
     * types, so no reachable baseline state corresponds to a signed-on user belonging to neither.</p>
     *
     * <p>Alternatives Considered: leaving the catch-all as {@code authenticated()} and adding an explicit
     * rule per published path, which is the shape the auth and card contexts use because each of those
     * has a genuinely per-path authority split. Rejected here: the per-path table would restate the same
     * authority set once per route and a route added later would default to the weaker rule again.
     * Requiring the authority set in the catch-all makes the safe outcome the DEFAULT rather than
     * something each new route has to remember to opt into.</p>
     *
     * <p>Trade-offs: a path this service does not publish now answers 403 rather than 404 for a token
     * with no group, where a token WITH a group still receives 404. The leak is bounded to callers who
     * already hold a validly signed token for this pool and reveals nothing about which paths exist,
     * which is a smaller cost than admitting an unauthorized principal to every published route.</p>
